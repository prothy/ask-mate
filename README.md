# Ask mate

This is a project we created over three sprints with one week each. We were tasked to create a StackOverflow-like website using Python Flask as a back-end and the Jinja templating engine as a front-end. Other than that we have a few lines of JavaScript that help with sorting and filtering the list of questions.

If you wish to try it out, I have deployed a version of it on Heroku.
