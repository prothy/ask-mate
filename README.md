# Ask mate

This is a project we created over three sprints with one week each. We were tasked to create a StackOverflow-like website using Python Flask as a back-end and the Jinja templating engine as a front-end. Other than that we have a few lines of JavaScript that help with sorting and filtering the list of questions. My work in it mainly includes writing the mentioned JavaScript and creating the stylesheet, along with helping in out the backend.

If you wish to try it out, I have deployed a version of it on Heroku ![here](https://prothy-ask-mate.herokuapp.com/).
